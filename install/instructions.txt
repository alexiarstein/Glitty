1. run the sql script or copy/paste it in phpmyadmin to create a "glitty" database
2. Create a glitty user and password and grant all privileges to this database.
3. modify ge_conn.php to add the newly created user and password so it can successfully connect to the database.


The rest of the settings are done once glitty is running, from the dashboard.
